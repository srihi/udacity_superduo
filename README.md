### Checking for edge cases and properly handling errors
  1. The application crashed when there is no internet connection instead of providing an appropriate error message.
  2. When internet connection is missing, the download of the book image fails and the application does not provide a proper placeholder for the missing image.
  
### Accessibility
  1. The application does not implement accessibility features.
    - There are some missing content descriptions for user interactable controls in any of the user interfaces.
    - Directional Pad or keyboard navigation for the interface elements are not handled explicitly which can be a problem as the app grows.

### Missing functionality
  1. The scan functionality is not implemented yet.

### Localization
  1. Localizable resources should be marked as localizable while resources that stay the same in any language (like setting keys for example) should be marked as non localizable.
