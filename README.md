### Checking for edge cases and properly handling errors
  1. The application crashed when there is no internet connection instead of providing an appropriate error message.
  
### Accessibility
  1. The application does not implement accessibility features.
    - There are some missing content descriptions for user interactable controls in any of the user interfaces.
    - Directional Pad or keyboard navigation for the interface elements are not handled explicitly which can be a problem as the app grows.

### Missing functionality
  1. The scan functionality is not implemented yet.
